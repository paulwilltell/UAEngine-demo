```
The cure for generic AI responses — adaptive interaction intelligence
```

### Description (260 chars max)
```
UAEngine analyzes how users write — pacing, punctuation, message complexity — and dynamically adapts your AI's response style. No model retraining. Works with any LLM. Stop generic answers. Start adaptive conversations.
```

### Full Description (for the listing)
```
## The Problem

Every AI gives the same response to every user. Frustrated developer gets the same wall of text as a curious beginner. Expert in a rush gets the same explanation as someone who's overwhelmed.

Generic responses = frustrated users = churn.

## The Solution

UAEngine is a lightweight middleware that sits between your users and your LLM. It analyzes **how** users write:

- Punctuation patterns ("???" vs "!!!")
- Message pacing and rhythm
- Cognitive load signals
- Likely follow-up intent

Then it shapes your AI's response accordingly:
- Frustrated user? → Lead with the fix, skip the explanation
- Beginner? → Use analogies, avoid jargon
- Expert in a rush? → 3 lines max, code first
- Overwhelmed? → One concept at a time, numbered steps

## What UAEngine Is NOT

❌ Not emotion detection or psychological diagnosis
❌ Not a replacement for your AI model
❌ Not "mind reading" — we analyze writing patterns, not mental states

## How It Works

1. User sends a message
2. UAEngine extracts signals (47ms latency)
3. Your app receives structured adaptation hints
4. You shape the system prompt accordingly
5. AI responds in the right style for that user

## Built For

- Customer support bots
- EdTech platforms
- Developer tools & documentation
- Any conversational AI that wants to feel less robotic

### Maker Comment (post after launch)
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I'm Paul, and I built UAEngine because I was tired of AI that treats every user the same.

The insight: users tell you HOW they want to be talked to through their writing style. A message full of "???" and caps lock is begging for a different response than "hey so i'm kinda new to this..."

UAEngine extracts those signals and tells your AI how to adapt — no model retraining, works with any LLM.

Would love your feedback! What signals would YOU want an AI to detect?

## 🔶 HackerNews Launch

### Title Options (pick one)
```
Show HN: UAEngine – Adaptive AI responses based on how users write

Show HN: I built a middleware that makes AI responses less generic

Show HN: Detect user frustration from punctuation patterns, adapt AI responses
```

### Post Body
```
I got frustrated with AI that gives the same response to everyone. An angry developer with "WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK???" gets the same wall of text as a curious beginner asking "what's an API?"

So I built UAEngine — a lightweight layer that analyzes how users write (pacing, punctuation, complexity) and tells your AI how to adapt its response style.

It's not emotion detection or psychology. It's pattern matching on writing signals:
- "???" clusters → likely confused, lead with clarity
- CAPS + exclamation → frustrated, lead with the fix
- Short lowercase messages → possibly expert, skip basics
- "slow down" / "wait" → overwhelmed, simplify

The output is structured hints your app uses to shape the system prompt. Works with any LLM.

Current status: Demo/prototype. Core logic is proprietary, but the concept is what I'm validating.

Interested in feedback on:
1. What other signals would be useful to detect?
2. Would you integrate something like this into your product?
3. Is the "adaptive response" framing clear or confusing?

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

### Version 1: Problem-Focused
```
Every AI chatbot has the same problem:

It treats a frustrated developer the same as a curious beginner.
It gives the same wall of text to an expert in a rush.
It doesn't adapt.

I built UAEngine to fix this.

It's a middleware layer that analyzes HOW users write:
→ Punctuation patterns ("???" = confused)
→ Message pacing (fast/slow/overwhelmed)
→ Complexity signals (beginner vs expert)

Then it tells your AI how to respond:
• Frustrated? Lead with the fix.
• Beginner? Use analogies.
• Expert? Skip the basics.
• Overwhelmed? One step at a time.

No model retraining. Works with any LLM. 47ms latency.

The cure for generic AI responses.

### Version 2: Story-Focused
```
I spent 3 hours debugging code. Nothing worked.

I asked an AI assistant for help. Its response?

"There could be several reasons why your code isn't working. Common causes include syntax errors, missing dependencies..."

I wanted to throw my laptop.

That experience made me build UAEngine.

It's simple: analyze how users write, adapt how AI responds.

When I type "WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK???" — don't give me a lecture. Give me the fix.

When I type "hey can you explain this simply?" — don't assume I'm an expert.

UAEngine detects these signals and shapes the AI's response style automatically.

Not emotion detection. Not mind reading. Just pattern matching on writing signals.

## 🐦 Twitter/X Posts

### Launch Tweet (Thread Starter)
```
I built an AI middleware that detects user frustration from punctuation.

Sounds weird. Here's why it works 🧵

Live demo: https://paulwilltell.github.io/UAEngine-demo/
```

### Thread (continue from above)
```
1/ The problem: AI treats everyone the same.

Frustrated dev gets a wall of text.
Beginner gets jargon.
Expert gets basics they don't need.

Generic responses = bad UX.
```

```
2/ The insight: users TELL you how they want to be talked to.

"WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK???" ← wants the fix NOW
"hey so what's an API" ← needs analogies
"k8s OOMKilled quick fix?" ← knows their stuff

The signals are in the text.
```

```
3/ UAEngine extracts those signals:

• Punctuation patterns
• Message pacing
• Cognitive load
• Likely next question

Then tells your AI: "respond like THIS for this user"
```

```
4/ It's NOT:
❌ Emotion detection
❌ Psychology diagnosis
❌ Mind reading

It's pattern matching on writing style. That's it.
```

```
5/ Results:

Same user message.
Dramatically different response quality.

Before: generic
After: adapted to that specific user

```

### Standalone Tweets

**Tweet 1:**
```
Hot take: The future of AI isn't smarter models.

It's AI that adapts to how YOU communicate.

Built a demo: https://paulwilltell.github.io/UAEngine-demo/
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
"WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK???"

vs

"hey what's an API"

Your AI should respond to these VERY differently.

Mine does now: https://paulwilltell.github.io/UAEngine-demo/
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Punctuation is data.

??? = confused
!!! = frustrated  
... = thinking
lowercase = casual

UAEngine reads these signals and adapts AI responses.
